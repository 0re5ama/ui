[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yasp-dota/ui.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yasp-dota/ui)

Web UI for YASP.  This is a SPA (single-page application) built with React, Redux, and React-Router.

Quickstart
----
* Install Node.js (6.0.0 or greater) (on Ubuntu, `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`)
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Visit port 8080 on your development machine.  You can configure the port used by webpack-dev-server in `webpack.config.js`.
* Ready to make a pull request? Run `npm run build` to make sure the build runs and there are no linting errors.

Tech stack
----
* View layer: React
* State management: Redux
* CSS: css-modules & postcss
* New to React/Redux? Read these articles on React and watch these egghead series by Redux creator Dan Abramov.

Notes
----
* For ease of development, the SPA is pointed to production YASP by default.  This means you don't need to set up the entire stack/get sample data.
* You can configure it to point to your own instance (if you are working on a backend feature) in `yasp.config.js`.

## How to add a new component connected to redux store (high level-ish)

###### Creating a table?

Copy table definitions (use tableContainerFactory.js factory function, look at Player.jsx for examples), create table columns, and add your request to the page you want (you may need to create a page, look at Peers.jsx or Player.jsx for examples)

###### copy reducer, change names

Copy an existing reducer. Depending on what data you are getting (array or object), get either gotPlayer/player.js or gotPlayer/matches.js

###### import into index.jsâ€™s and combine reducers that are relevant

###### copy actions & change names

In the future I will probably have a factory function for these since a lot of them are very similar

###### actions index changes

###### copy/change sort and transform selectors

These files are only needed if you are transforming the data (or sorting it, or any other selector is being used)

###### selectors index changes

Same rules apply as above

###### add transformations if they are needed

If you are transforming the data, add it to the transformations.js

If I left anything out, I will update this guide. It's only a general idea of what files need to be changed
