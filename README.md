Tech Stack
----
* View: React
* State management: Redux
* CSS: css-modules/postcss

Notes
----
* Setup takes 5 minutes!
* You can develop the UI independently of the backend!
  * This means you don't have to set up the entire stack (databases, etc.)
  * You can configure it to point to your own backend instance (if you are working on a new feature).
* API Documentation: https://odota.github.io/docs
* Discord: https://discord.gg/0o5SQGbXuWCNDcaF
  * Strongly recommended for active developers!
  * You can get help rapidly and coordinate with others.
